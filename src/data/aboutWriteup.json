	"I'm Irfan!\n\nI am a senior undergraduate student at Cornell University studying computer science. I've been fortunate to have had a lot of experience in a slew of different areas, from design and software engineering to research to pedagogy. That notwithstanding, I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow!",
	"I'm interested in wide range of things (aren't we all!) but right now, I'm interested in stochastic processes and stochastic modeling of systems. I've found applications of this when working on computational projects in population genetics, such as my involvement in a project studying transmission in Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB). I'm also just interested in the development of better computational methods in computational biology in general.\n\nI'm also interested in computer architecture and systems programming, particularly in hardware acceleration of algorithms. Recently, I've taken interest in parallel computing as I used CUDA in a novel analysis in the aforementioned MTB project.\n\nNon-exhaustively, some of my other interests include machine learning, linguistics, and computer vision.",
	"Currently, I am in my final semester (graduating in December!), still engaged as a learner and a teacher as I work on my repertoire of projects as well as being a Teaching Assistant for CS 3700, the Foundations of AI Reasoning and Decision-Making course here at Cornell.",
	"If I find myself having extra daylight sometimes, I like to go running, do photography, learn new languages, tend to my plants, and cook+bake for my house. Let's be in touch, and thank you for getting acquainted with me!"
